# 🚀 Engineering Handoff - PDF Signer Project

## Project Overview
**Repository:** https://github.com/mattsilv/sign-pdf  
**Stack:** React + TypeScript + Vite + PDF.js + Playwright  
**Status:** Mobile refactoring partially complete, needs E2E testing and polish

## 🎯 Critical Priority: E2E Testing

### What Needs Testing
The most important task is ensuring the basic user journey works flawlessly:

1. **User loads the app** → Works on both desktop and mobile
2. **Clicks "Try with Sample NDA Document"** → PDF loads successfully  
3. **Places annotations** (text, signature, date, initials) → Annotations appear correctly
4. **Exports/downloads the PDF** → PDF generates with all annotations

### Test Files to Run
```bash
# New comprehensive test (just created)
npm run test -- tests/e2e/complete-user-journey.spec.ts

# Existing tests that need verification
npm run test -- tests/e2e/signature-workflows.spec.js
npm run test -- tests/mobile/swipe-navigation.spec.ts
npm run test -- tests/mobile/responsive-toolbar.spec.ts
```

## 🔧 Current State

### ✅ What's Working
- **Linting:** Passes with 0 errors (7 warnings)
- **Dev Server:** Running on port 5173
- **ResponsiveToolbar:** Switches at 768px breakpoint
- **Swipe Navigation:** Implemented in VirtualizedPDFViewer
- **Haptic Feedback:** Integrated for mobile interactions
- **Pre-commit Hook:** Fixed to handle dynamic ports

### ⚠️ Known Issues
1. **Test Infrastructure:** Some tests timeout - need proper wait conditions
2. **Touch Interactions:** AnnotationLayer needs better mobile support
3. **Missing Test PDF:** `coordinate_test.pdf` doesn't exist (tests updated to use sample NDA)
4. **Port Conflicts:** Dev server sometimes conflicts between 5173/5174

## 🐛 Issues to Fix

### High Priority
1. **E2E Test Failures:** Run the complete-user-journey test and fix any failures
2. **Mobile Touch Events:** AnnotationLayer doesn't handle touch properly
3. **Test Stability:** Add proper waits and error handling

### Medium Priority  
4. **React Hook Warnings:** useVirtualizedPages has cleanup issues
5. **Performance:** Test on older mobile devices
6. **Offline Mode:** Service worker needs testing

### Low Priority
7. **Code Comments:** Remove unnecessary console.logs
8. **Documentation:** Update README with mobile features
9. **Analytics:** Add usage tracking

## 🚦 Getting Started

### 1. Setup Environment
```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/mattsilv/sign-pdf.git
cd sign-pdf
npm install

# Start dev server
npm run dev  # Runs on http://localhost:5173

# Run tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npm run test -- tests/e2e/complete-user-journey.spec.ts

# Run tests with UI (easier debugging)
npx playwright test --ui
```

### 2. Test the Basic Flow Manually
1. Open http://localhost:5173
2. Click "Try with Sample NDA Document"
3. Add text annotation (click Text tool → click on PDF → type → Enter)
4. Add signature (click Signature → type name → Save → click on PDF)
5. Export PDF (click Export/Download)
6. **Verify PDF downloads with annotations intact**

### 3. Run E2E Tests
```bash
# Desktop journey
npm run test -- tests/e2e/complete-user-journey.spec.ts --grep "Desktop"

# Mobile journey  
npm run test -- tests/e2e/complete-user-journey.spec.ts --grep "Mobile"
```

### 4. Fix Any Test Failures
- Tests will likely fail initially - that's expected!
- Use `npx playwright test --ui` for visual debugging
- Check for timing issues (add waitForSelector)
- Verify selectors match actual DOM elements

## 📝 GitHub Issues to Create

### Issue #23: Complete E2E Testing & Stabilization
```markdown
## Description
The core user journey needs comprehensive testing on both desktop and mobile to ensure basic functionality works reliably.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Desktop E2E test passes (load → annotate → export)
- [ ] Mobile E2E test passes with touch interactions
- [ ] Swipe navigation works on mobile devices
- [ ] Signature persistence works across sessions
- [ ] PDF exports correctly with all annotations

## Test Coverage Required
- Complete user journey (see tests/e2e/complete-user-journey.spec.ts)

npm test                       # Run all tests
npm run test:mobile           # Run mobile tests only
npx playwright test --ui      # Visual test debugger
npx playwright test --debug   # Step through tests

# Code Quality
npm run lint                  # Check for issues
npm run format               # Auto-format code

# Git (with pre-commit bypass if needed)
git add .
git commit -m "message"      # Will run pre-commit hook
git commit --no-verify -m "message"  # Skip pre-commit
```

## 🔍 Debugging Tips

1. **Test Failures:** Use `npx playwright test --ui` for visual debugging
2. **Port Conflicts:** Kill process on 5173: `lsof -ti:5173 | xargs kill -9`
3. **Console Logs:** Check browser DevTools and terminal output
4. **Mobile Testing:** Use Chrome DevTools device emulation
5. **Real Devices:** Use ngrok or local network IP
