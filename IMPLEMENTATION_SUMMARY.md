# Draggable Annotations Implementation Summary

## Issue #2 Resolution
Successfully implemented draggable annotations feature to fix the UX issue where clicking existing annotations created duplicates instead of selecting them.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Selection-First Behavior ✅
- Clicking on existing annotations now SELECTS them (shows blue border)
- No more duplicate annotations when clicking existing ones
- Click detection uses hit boxes appropriate for each annotation type

### 2. Visual Selection Indicators ✅
- Selected annotations show blue 2px solid border
- Selection box with visual feedback
- Hover effect for better discoverability
- 8 resize handles for signatures (corners + midpoints)

### 3. Drag-and-Drop Functionality ✅
- Smooth dragging of annotations to new positions
- Real-time position updates during drag
- Cursor changes to indicate draggable state
- Maintains proper PDF coordinate conversion

### 4. Resize Functionality ✅
- Signatures can be resized using corner handles
- Maintains aspect ratio during resize
- Minimum size constraints to prevent too-small annotations

### 5. Keyboard Shortcuts ✅
- ESC key deselects current annotation
- Delete key removes selected annotation (with confirmation)

### 6. Enhanced User Experience ✅
- Transitions for smooth visual feedback
- Proper z-index management
- No interference with PDF navigation

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
1. **src/App.tsx**
   - Added selectedAnnotationId state
   - Added handleAnnotationUpdate for position updates
   - Added handleAnnotationSelect for selection management

2. **src/components/PDFViewer.tsx**
   - Implemented getAnnotationAtPoint for hit detection
   - Added drag handling with mouse events
   - Added resize handling for signatures
   - Integrated selection visual indicators
   - Added keyboard event handlers

### Coordinate System
- Preserved existing coordinate conversion (works perfectly)
- Used CoordinateMapper for all transformations
- Drag deltas properly converted to PDF coordinates

## Testing

### Manual Testing
- Created test_coordinate_grid.pdf with visual targets
- Verified selection, dragging, and resizing work correctly
- Confirmed exported PDFs contain annotations at dragged positions

### E2E Tests Created
- `tests/draggable-annotations.spec.ts` with comprehensive test coverage:
  - Selection instead of duplication
  - Drag position updates
  - Export verification
  - ESC key deselection
  - Signature resize handles

## Success Criteria Met
✅ Click existing annotation → Shows selection box (not duplicate)
✅ Drag annotation → Moves smoothly
✅ Export PDF → Annotation at dragged position
✅ E2E tests created and documented

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
- Multi-select with Shift+click
- Copy/paste annotations
- Undo/redo functionality
- Snap-to-grid for precise alignment
